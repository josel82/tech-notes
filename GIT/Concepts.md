# Concepts
#Git 

Git is a distributed version control system

## Git Environments
1. Working files
Here is were you can edit your files.

2. Staging
Here we add the file to the repository but we still haven't commit the changes
```bash
git add file_name
```

3. Commit
Changes are sent to the main branch
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message here"
```

## Git objects
- Commits
- Blobs (Files)
- Trees (Directories)
- Tags

## Branches
### Head branch
- Currently active (checked-out) branch.

### Local branch
- Branch in our local repository.
- You can only create branches on your local repository.

### Remote branch
- Branch in the remote repository e.g. Github, Gitlab, etc.
- Branches are created by publishing existing local branches.
