- 2 Tier (Collapse Core) Architecture is good for one building

	CORE Switches (ACLs, QoS, Routing, etc)

	ACCESS Switches (Provide access to devices)

- 3 Tier Architecture is good for a Campus Network (multiple buildings in the same location

	CORE Switches (Fast)

	DISTRIBUTION Switches (ACLs, QoS, Routing, etc)

	ACCESS Switches (Provide access to devices)

- Spine-Leaf Architecture is good for East-West traffic (Data Center-Cloud)

	SPINE is backbone only, server connect to leafs (Top Of Rack Switches)

	LEAF there are connections everywhere. Full mesh between spine/leaf. Lighting-fast east-west traffic flow.

-  WAN
-  SOHO
-  On premise vs cloud architecture
