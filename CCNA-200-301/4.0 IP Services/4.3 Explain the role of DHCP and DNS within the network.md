## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
It is a protocol used for the automatic allocation of IP addresses of devices within a local network

## DNS (Domain Name System)
It is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, and other resources connected to the internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the associated entities. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so that browsers can load internet resources.
