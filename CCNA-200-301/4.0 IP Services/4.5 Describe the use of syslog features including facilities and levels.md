## Configuration
All of the following are global config commands

### Console
Enables log messaging on the console
```
logging console
```
Sets message level
```
logging console [level-name | level-number]
```

### Terminal (SSH or Telnet session)
Enables log messages on the terminal session
```
logging monitor
```
Sets message level 
```
logging monitor [level-name | level-number]
```
Note: A user who connects to a cisco device via SSH or Telnet would need to issue the following command (EXEC level command) to see the log messages:
```
terminal monitor
```

### Buffered
Configure the device to buffer log messages
```
logging buffered
```
Sets message level 
```
logging buffered [level-name | level-number]
```

### Syslog
Configures the device to send log messages to a Syslog server
```
logging host [address | hostname]
```
Sets message level 
```
logging trap [level-name | level-number]
```


## Example

R1
```
logging console 7
logging monitor debug
logging buffered 4
logging host 172.16.10.50
logging trap warning
```

In this example we configure R1 with the commands shown above. With this settings console users will be able to see logs messages from level 7 all the way down to level 0. Remote users will also be able to see all levels of messages, but not before they issue the `terminal monitor` command on their terminal session. Also, only messages of level 4 - 0 will be buffered. Messages of level 4 to 0 will be sent to a Syslog server with IP 172.16.10.50
