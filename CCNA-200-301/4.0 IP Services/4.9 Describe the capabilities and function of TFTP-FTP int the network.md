## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Is a network protocol used for transferring files from one computer to another over a TCP network. It used client-network architecture, which means that a user has to have a FTP client installed to access the FTP server running on a remote machine. After establishing the TFP connection, the user can download or upload files to and from the FTP server.

## TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
Is a network protocol used for transferring files between remote machines. It is a simpler version of FTP, lacking some of the more advanced features FTP offers, but requiring less resources that FTP. Because of its simplicity, TFTP ca be used only to send and receive files.
