# Configure WLAN using WPA2 PSK using the GUI
#CCNA #IT 

# Security
After a WLAN has been created and the General Setup is done, we can proceed to the Security tab which is where we can define security options.

## Layer 2 
In the CCNA 200-301 exam we will be required to select WPA+WPA2 in the Layer 2 Security dropdown.
Then we must check the PSK option int the Authentication Key Management Menu. Next up, we will enter a PSK Key. we can select ASCII as PSK Format. The key must be at least 8 characters long.

## Layer 3
On this section we can set a Web Policy, and we can implement one of the following options:
### Web Authentication
After the wireless clients gets and IP address and tries to access a web page, they will have to enter a username and password to authenticate
### Web Passthrough
Similar to the above but no username or password are required. A warning or statement is displayed and client simply has to agree to gain access to the internet
### Conditional and Splash Page
These web redirect options are similar, but additionally require 802.1X layer 2 authentication

## AAA 
Since we will be required to implement a PSK key, we don't need to do anything on this tab.
