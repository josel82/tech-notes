## Threat
According to Cisco, a threat is a potential or actual event that may cause harm to the **confidentiality**, **integrity** or **availability** of information or systems. A threat can be either natural or human-made, and can exploit a vulnerability in software or hardware components.
## Vulnerability
Is a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, or **availability**.
## Exploits
In cyber security, exploits are programs or pieces of code that maliciously take advantage of vulnerabilities or security flaws in software or hardware to infiltrate and initiate attacks or install malware. Exploits are not malware themselves but rather they are methods used by cyber criminals to deliver malware. Exploits can target different types of vulnerabilities, such as software bugs, network configurations, personnel credentials, physical site security, an so on. 
## Mitigation Techniques
Are methods or practices that aim to reduce the risk or impact of cyber attacks on an organization's systems, data, and operations. They should be implemented everywhere a vulnerability can be exploited: client devices, servers, switches, routers, firewalls, etc.

## Common Attacks
### DoS (Denial of Service)
Threatens the availability of a system. One common DoS attack is the TCP SYN flood, where the attacker spoofs IP addresses and sends multiply TCP SYN requests to a server overwhelming its TCP connection table.
### DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
Similar to DoS attacks, but in this case the attacker infects many target computers with malware and uses them all to initiate a denial-of-service attack.
### Spoofing attacks
In these type of attacks, the attacker fakes IP addresses or MAC addresses in order to exploit a vulnerability. Other types of attacks involve spoofing. E.g., DHCP exhaustion which is a DoS attack uses MAC address spoofing, sending multiple DHCP request in order to overwhelm a DHCP server
### Reflexion/amplification attacks
In a reflexion attack, the attacker sends traffic to a reflector, and spoofs the source address of its packets using the target's IP address. The reflector (i.e. a DNS server) sends the reply to the target's IP address. If the amount of traffic sent to the target is large enough, this can result in a DoS attack.

A reflexion attack becomes an amplification attack when the amount of traffic sent by the attacker is small, but it triggers a large amount of traffic to be sent from the reflector to the target.
### Man-in-the-middle attacks
In a man-in-the-middle attack the attacker places himself between the source and destination to intersect communication, or to modify traffic before it reaches the destination. A common example is ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning. In this type of attach a host sends an ARP request, asking for the MAC address of another device. The attacker receives this packet since it is flooded by the switch. The attacker waits and sends an ARP reply with its own MAC address. If the attacker's reply arrives after the real reply, this overrides it, so now all the traffic destined to that device will go to the attacker. The attacker then receives the packets and resends them to the destination. In the process the may be able to see sensitive information or even modify it, compromising **confidentiality** and **integrity**.
### Reconnaissance attacks
These aren't attacks themselves, but they are used to gather information about a target which can be used for a future attack. This is often public available information. i.e. `nslookup` to learn the IP address of a site, or a WHOIS query to learn email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, etc.
### Malware
A variety of harmful programs that can infect a computer.
- **Viruses** infect other software (a host program). The virus spreads as the software is shared by users. Typically they corrupt or modify files on the target computer.
- **Worms** don not require a host program. They are standalone malware and they are able to spread on their own, without user interaction. The spread of worms can congest the network, but the payload of a worm can cause additional harm to target devices.
- **Trojan horses** are harmful software that is distinguished as legitimate software. They are spread through user interaction such as email attachments, or downloading a file from the internet.
These are only some of the most common types of malware, but there are many different types that can compromise any of the CIA of the target device.
### Social Engineering
This type of attack aims the most vulnerable part of any system - people. They involve psychological manipulation to make the target reveal confidential information or perform some action.
Here are some of the most common types of Social Engineering attacks:
- **Phishing** typically involves fraudulent emails that appear to come from a legitimate business and contain links to a fraudulent website that seems legitimate. Users are told to login to the fraudulent website, providing their login credentials to the attacker.
	- **Spear phishing** is more targeted form of phishing, i.e. aimed at employees of a certain company/
	- **Whaling** is phishing targeted at high profile individuals, i.e. a company's president.
- **Vishing** (voice phishing) is phishing performed over the phone.
- **Smishing** (SMS phishing) is phishing using SMS text messages.
- **Watering hole** attacks comprise sites that the target victim frequently visits. If a malicious link is placed on a website the target trusts, they might not hesitate to click it.
- **Tailgating** attacks involves entering restricted, secured areas by simply walking in behind an authorized person as they enter. Often the target will hold the door open for the attacker to be polite, assuming the attacker is also authorized to enter.
### Password related attacks
Most systems use username/password combination to authenticate users. The username is often simple/easy to guess, and the strength and secrecy of the password is relied on to provide the necessary security.

Attackers can learn a user's password via multiple methods:
- Guessing
- **Dictionary attack**: a program runs through a 'dictionary' or list of common word/passwords to find the target's password.
- **Brute force attack:**  a program tries every possible combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to find the target's password.
