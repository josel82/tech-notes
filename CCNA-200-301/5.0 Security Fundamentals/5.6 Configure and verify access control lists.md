# Configure and verify access control lists
#CCNA #IT #CyberSecurity 



# Standard numbered ACLs
First you declare the access-list in global configuration mode:
`Router(config)#access-list`\[1-99 | 1300-1999] \[permit | deny] *source Ip address* *wilcard mask*

Once declared, the access-list needs to be applied to an interface, specifying the direction in which traffic will be checked against \[Inbound | outbound]. You can apply an access-list in interface config mode:
`Router(config-if)#ip access-group`*number* \[in | out]

Access-list can have several entries. In standard number access-list you can add more entries as follows:

```
R1(config)#access-list 1 deny 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)#access-list 1 permit any
```
This access list denies access only to network 192.168.10.0/24

Then we could applied to an interface as in the following example:
```
R1(config)#interface gigabitEthernet 0/2
R1(config-if)ip access-group 1 out
```
In this example we applied the access-list to R1's G0/2 interface outbound, in order to deny traffic coming from network 192.168.10.0/24 to the network attached to this interface.

# Standard named ACLs
We declare named ACLs as follows:
`Router(config)#ip access-list standard` *name* 
`Router(config-std-nacl)#`*sequence number*  \[permit | deny]   *source IP   wilcard mask* 



# Extended Access Control List

## Practice
1. From web client 10.1.1.1, sent to a web server in subnet 10.1.2.0/24.
```
access-list 101 permit tcp host 10.1.1.1 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq www
```
2. From Telnet client 172.16.4.3/25, sent to a Telnet server in subnet 172.16.3.0/25. Match all hosts in the client's subnet as well.
```
access-list 102 permit tcp 172.16.4.0 0.0.0.127 172.16.3.0 0.0.0.127 eq telnet 
```

3. ICMP messages from the subnet in which 192.168.7.200/26 resides to all hosts the subnet where 192.168.7.14/29 resides.
```
access-list 103 permit icmp 192.168.7.20 0.0.0.63 192.168.7.14 0.0.0.15
```

4. From web server 10.2.3.4/23's subnet to clients in the same subnet as host 10.4.5.6/22
```
access-list 104 permit tcp 10.2.3.0 0.0.1.255 eq 80 10.4.5.0 0.0.3.255
```

5. From Telnet server 172.20.1.0/24's subnet, sent to any host in the same subnet as host 172.20.44.1/23.
```
access-list 105 permit tcp 172.20.1.0 0.0.0.255 eq 23 172.20.44.0 0.0.1.255
```

6. From web client 192.168.99.99/28, sent to a web server in subnet 192.168.176.0/28. Match all hosts int client's subnet as well.
```
access-list 106 permit tcp 192.168.99.96 0.0.0.15 192.168.176.0 0.0.0.15 eq www
```

7. ICMP messages from the subnet in which 10.55.66.77/25 resides to all hosts in the subnet where 10.66.55.44/26 resides.
```
access-list 107 permit icmp 10.55.66.0 0.0.0.127 10.66.55.0 0.0.0.63
```

8. Any and every IPv4 packet.
```
access-list 108 permit ip any any 
```
